Reply: The subject performed a deep squat with a significant hips-dominated bias, indicating that their technique was primarily influenced by their hip position rather than other factors like knee or ankle mobility. This bias suggests that they may need to focus on improving overall lower body stability and flexibility for better depth in the squat.

The main issue observed during the analysis is a trunk position that tends to move forward initially, which can affect overall stability and control throughout the movement. This tendency to have a forward trunk position persists across different phases of the squat.
